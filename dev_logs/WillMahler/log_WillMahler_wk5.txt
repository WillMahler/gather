- Held a team meeting to go over items from last week's meeting that did not get
  discussed
- Planned and held the team meeting with new items that needed discussing, including:
  - Database Structure Review
  - Mockup Review
  - Team Meeting Day/Time (to see if we could find another day/time)
  - Deliverable #2
  - Github Workflow
- Decisions were made on many of these pieces and what we should start prioritizing for
  D2. We decided to prioritize Authentication, Event Creation, Friend Requesting
- We decided to do trunk-based development
- Later on, I'll put in criteria for pull requests (reviewers/build success)

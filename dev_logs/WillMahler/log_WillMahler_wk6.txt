- Nick transferred the repo to my Github account so that I can implement the checks
- Did hypothetical walkthroughs of the app via the Figma mockups to try to identify
  every piece that needs to be implemented for D2
- Delved into Firebase documentation and resources to try to help with data structuring
- Created a ton of issues in Github in our repo (over 40) to track all of the items
  that need to be completed for D2
  - Where practical, filled out the issues with details/resources
  - Where appropriate, linked issues and identified ones that would need to be
    completed beforehand
- Created issue labels and milestones on repo to help with tracking and progressing

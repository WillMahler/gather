- Set up daily meetings to keep us on track and keep communication open 
  for D3 report due date
- Checked into refactoring the RecyclerViews using the Visitor pattern, but
  after a few hours of reading/researching, it doesn't seem like ours can 
  use this pattern, since ours also have onClick methods that vary and the 
  only way I found how to address this is with things that are available 
  in Kotlin, but not in Java

- Attempted refactoring RecyclerViews using Factory pattern, but ran into same issue
  as with Visitor pattern - onClickListeners hinder refactoring using either pattern
- Refactored:
	- RecyclerViews, separated clickListeners, ViewHolders, and adapters
	- EventDetails tabbed activity; removed budget/task, replaced with
          Details and People tabs instead. Also populated People tab with text headings
          and RecyclerViews with test user data
- Enabled users to invite guests to events in the UI via their email
  - Implemented a guest list RecyclerView which also allows users to remove
    guests they've added
  - Implemented a check to ensure emails can only be added if they're registered
    in our app
- Started preparing my part of the D3 presentation script and slides

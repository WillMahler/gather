- Team meeting in which we partnered off. I will be working on the backend/server side
with Nick Scott.
- Meeting with Nick to talk about the back end service that we will be using. We settled
on using Firebase, as it allowed us to easily integrate a lot of the functionality we 
needed. Another key point with Firebase is its secure Authentication, which was 
something we were worried about.

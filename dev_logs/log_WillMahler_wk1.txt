- Had a Team meeting where we started planning out all of the high-level areas
  we need to address and complete, along with the lower-level tasks within those
  categories
- Having a team meeting the week of Sept 27 to more or less finalize this
  planning out and start delegating areas/tasks to people to work on
- Also going to be discussing in this team meeting how we can ensure we meet the
  deadlines and how often would be good to come together to touch base and
  update each other
- Will be pushing a basic android app commit

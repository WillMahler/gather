- Refactored code that handled user authentication and data base queries for user profiles
- Implemented logs on key points in authentication process & user profile create in database 
  allowing for easier debugging
- Added UI elements to the 'CreateEvent' activity:
	- UI design for this activity follows the same idea for the 'SpecificEvent' activity
	- Holds a TabbedView with 3 tabs for the different sections of an event: summary, tasks,
	  and budget
- Must discuss details with Will as he will be completing the 'SpecificEvent' activity UI
